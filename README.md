# Voice-assistant-program-for-pronunciation-practicing

built a voice assistant program for pronunciation practicing.
The program will analyze real-time audio stream and react. It can automatically repeat user’s voice and respond to user’s voice command.
Used a tiny 70MB speech to text model to understand user’s voice and show the text contents on user interface.
Used NLP to distinguish user’s voice command, like “stop”, and react accordingly.
Used gTTS as text to speech module, which enables our program to communicate with user via voice.
